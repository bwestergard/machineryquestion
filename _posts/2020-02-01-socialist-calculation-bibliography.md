## Introduction

Following my review of Philips and Rozworski's _People's Republic of Wal-Mart_ I've been having many more conversations with politically-minded friends about socialist planning.

While I'm happy to see that book spark so many conversations, I've argued that its overview of the socialist calculation debate is deficient in key ways and that its central thesis - that the information technology systems of e-commerce giants prefigure those of socialist planning - is highly misleading. What would I reccomend to get a sense of the real issues?

What follows is an an enthusiastic amateur's selective bibliography, lightly annotated. I hope it saves you time and prompts new thinking and writing on the topic. I have broken these suggestions up into a few categories, and within each category have tried to list texts in a rough priority order. In other words, it would probably make more sense to read the first one or two texts in each category, before reading any of the third or fourth items.

Part of what makes the debate over socialist planning so interesting is the way it undermines existing disciplinary boundaries. It helps to know a bit about economics, law, critical theory (particularly regarding technology), the sociology of professions (includng science and technology studies), computer science, normative political philosophy, state theory, etc. At the same time, the temptation to eclectisism, of dodging objections raised in one disciplinary niche by fleeing to another, is ever present.

## The Critique of Capital

Disagreements over proposed alternatives to capitalism often reflect disagreements over the nature of capitalism. The concerns of many contributors to the socialist calculation debate are unintelligible without some familiarity with critical theories of capitalism. Far and away the most influential of these was and is Karl Marx's critique of political economy. For that, I'd reccommend:

- "Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital" (Heinrich): In this short and accessible book, Michael Heinrich summarizes the key points made in Marx's unfinished magnum opus _Das Kapital_. Heinrich takes pains to distinguish between the views expressed by Marx and the "worldview Marxism" codified by later generations of intellectuals, of which he is rightly critical.
- "Socialism" (Berki): This relatively little-known book

- "The Economics of Feasible Socialism" (Alec Nove)
